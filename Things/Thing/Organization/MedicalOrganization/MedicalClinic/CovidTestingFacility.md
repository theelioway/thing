# CovidTestingFacility

A CovidTestingFacility is a <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/MedicalClinic">MedicalClinic</a> where testing for the COVID-19 Coronavirus
disease is available. If the facility is being made available from an established <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Pharmacy">Pharmacy</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Hotel">Hotel</a>, or other
non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information
about that place e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.

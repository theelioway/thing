# ProductGroup

A ProductGroup represents a group of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Product">Product</a>s that vary only in certain well-described ways, such as by <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/size">size</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/color">color</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/material">material</a> etc.<br/><br/>

While a ProductGroup itself is not directly offered for sale, the various varying products that it represents can be. The ProductGroup serves as a prototype or template, standing in for all of the products who have an <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/isVariantOf">isVariantOf</a> relationship to it. As such, properties (including additional types) can be applied to the ProductGroup to represent characteristics shared by each of the (possibly very many) variants. Properties that reference a ProductGroup are not included in this mechanism; neither are the following specific properties <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/variesBy">variesBy</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/hasVariant">hasVariant</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/url">url</a>.

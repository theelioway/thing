# WebContent

WebContent is a type representing all <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebPage">WebPage</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebSite">WebSite</a> and <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebPageElement">WebPageElement</a> content. It is sometimes the case that detailed distinctions between Web pages, sites and their parts is not always important or obvious. The <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebContent">WebContent</a> type makes it easier to describe Web-addressable content without requiring such distinctions to always be stated. (The intent is that the existing types <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebPage">WebPage</a>, <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebSite">WebSite</a> and <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebPageElement">WebPageElement</a> will eventually be declared as subtypes of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/WebContent">WebContent</a>.)

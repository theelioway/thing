# ComicIssue

Individual comic issues are serially published as
part of a larger series. For the sake of consistency, even one-shot issues
belong to a series comprised of a single issue. All comic issues can be
uniquely identified by: the combination of the name and volume number of the
series to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant
description of the issue (if any).

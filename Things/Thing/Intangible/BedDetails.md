# BedDetails

An entity holding detailed information about the available bed types, e.g. the quantity of twin beds for a hotel room. For the single case of just one bed of a certain type, you can use bed directly with a text. See also <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/BedType">BedType</a> (under development).

# AggregateOffer

When a single product is associated with multiple offers (for example, the same pair of shoes is offered by different merchants), then AggregateOffer can be used.<br/><br/>

Note: AggregateOffers are normally expected to associate multiple offers that all share the same defined <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/businessFunction">businessFunction</a> value, or default to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell if businessFunction is not explicitly defined.

# LinkRole

A Role that represents a Web link e.g. as expressed via the 'url' property. Its linkRelationship property can indicate URL-based and plain textual link types e.g. those in IANA link registry or others such as 'amphtml'. This structure provides a placeholder where details from HTML's link element can be represented outside of HTML, e.g. in JSON-LD feeds.

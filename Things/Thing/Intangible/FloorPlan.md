# FloorPlan

A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use, some <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/ApartmentComplex">ApartmentComplex</a> has an <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/accommodationFloorPlan">accommodationFloorPlan</a> which is a <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/FloorPlan">FloorPlan</a>. A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, either a larger <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/ApartmentComplex">ApartmentComplex</a> or a single <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Apartment">Apartment</a>. The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan">see wikipedia</a>) can be indicated using <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/image">image</a>.
